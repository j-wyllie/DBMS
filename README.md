# SENG302 Team 200: Human Farm

## Compiling
This project uses maven to compile the project.

From a terminal window, change directory to the project root directory and execute the following:

    mvn -B clean site package

This will download any required dependencies and compile the program to the `target` folder.

## Running
To run the application once compiled, change terminal directory to the target folder and execute 
the following:

    java -jar odms-0.x.jar

This will bring you into the application which can be terminated at any time by executing the 
`quit` command.
